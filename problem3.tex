\section{Practice with Maxwellian \\distributions}

For a Maxwellian distribution of velocities with one-dimensional dispersion $\sigma$,
show that:

\subsection{}
the mean speed is $\Bar{v}=(8/\pi)^{1/2}\sigma$

\subsection{}
the mean-square speed is $\Bar{v^2}=3\sigma^2$

\subsection{}
the mean-square of one component of velocity is $\Bar{v^2_x}=\sigma^2$

\subsection{}
the mean\-square relative speed of any two particles is $\Bar{v^2_{rel}}=6\sigma^2$

\subsection{}
the fraction of particles with $v^2>4\Bar{v^2}$ is 0.00738
