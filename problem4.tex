\section{Practice with the virial equations}

A stationary stellar system of negligible mass and finite extent is confined by the
potential  $\Phi(r)=v_c^2\ln{r}+constant$.

\subsection{}
Prove that the mean-square velocity is $\langle v^2 \rangle = v_c^2$, independent of the shape, radial
profile, or other properties of the stellar system. Hint: as in the derivation of the virial
theorem, consider the behavior of $d^2I/dt^2$ where in this case $I=r^2$.

\subsection{}
The singular isothermal sphere has the same potential (eq. 4.104), but in this system
the mean-square velocity is $\langle v^2\rangle = 3\sigma^2 = \frac{3}{2}v_c^2$. How is this consistent with the result of
part (a)?
